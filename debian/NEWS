bacula (5.2.6+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=high

  Significant changes since versions before 5.2.6+dfsg-1:

  [ Jan Hauke Rahm ]
  * bacula-fd, -sd, and -director now ship /etc/default/bacula-{fd,sd,dir}
    accordingly. The new files contain possibilities to disable the service,
    provide additional arguments passed to the daemon, and specify a
    configuration file other than the default. Do not delete these files.

  * The binary /usr/bin/bconsole (formerly a wrapper around
    /usr/sbin/bacula-console) has been dropped as it made assumptions
    about where your configuration file is (/etc/bacula/bconsole.conf).
    It is now a symlink to /usr/sbin/bconsole: if no configuration file is
    specified, /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf is used by default.

  [ Luca Capello ]
  * Upstream installs console and tray-monitor binaries (bat, bconsole and
    bacula-tray-monitor) into /usr/sbin/, while Debian were installing
    them into /usr/bin/.  However, in such case there is no real advantage
    in deviating from upstream, also because the default configuration
    files have anyway tighter ownership (root:bacula) and permissions
    (640).  Thus, these binaries have been migrated to /usr/sbin/, with
    symlinks in place to allow a smooth migration from squeeze and they
    will be removed once wheezy is released.

bacula (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * SSL/TLS is now available in Bacula in Debian.

bacula (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * SSL/TLS has been disabled in this version of Bacula due to licensing
    concerns.  See README.Debian and the thread at
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2007/07/msg00144.html for more
    details.

bacula (1.38.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Welcome to the 1.38 series of Bacula.

    This version of Bacula in Debian introduces some significant changes in the 
    Debian packages.  PostgreSQL director packages and MySQL packages
    have already switched to using dbconfig-common.  And new Sqlite3
    packages are available.
